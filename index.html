            <li>I talk a little about the structure of GitHub. I describe
                branching and its use in separating projects, and how to merge
                branches. (This gives web site time to refresh.)

            <li>I re-load web site and see new to-do. Shocked!

            <li>I add new issue: "Syed, can you please fix up the index?"

                Syed adds, "I know, Adnan, I think he will go on all night
                unless someone intervenes."
